# genmail

DESCRIPTION

Creates a Gmail "Sub UserName" for an email address.

i.e. ( foo@bar.com => foo+123456@bar.com )

## Installation

Select the latest release `tar.gz` file by clicking the latest project release. Copy the URL for the `.tar.gz` file and paste it into a `cpanm` command.

**NOTE:** Though it's "bad practice", I haven't pushed any of this to CPAN. I have no plans to push this out to CPAN at this point as it's such a specific use case. Feel free to use/modify/ignore as you see fit.

**Example:**

```sh
cpanm https://github.com/hashref/perl_generate_plus_gmail_address/archive/refs/tags/v1.0.0.tar.gz
```
